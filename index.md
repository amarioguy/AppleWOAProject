## Welcome to the M1 Windows project

Keeping things simple, the goal is to hopefully run Windows on Apple's M1 chip (and hopefully future Apple silicon chips too!)

### Why a whole project for this?

Contrary to how it may appear on the surface, Apple's chips are architecturally very different from standard ARM64 chips from companies like Qualcomm or MediaTek and a lot of hardware enablement needs to be done as a result.
